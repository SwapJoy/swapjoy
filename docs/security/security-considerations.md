# Security Considerations

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### Password Security
- **Password Requirements:**
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter

  - Never store plaintext passwords
  - Never log passwords

### Token Management
- **Access Tokens (JWT):**
  - Short expiration: 15 minutes
  - Signed with RS256 (asymmetric)
  - Include minimal claims (user_id, role)
  - Stored in secure storage (not localStorage)

- **Refresh Tokens:**
  - Long expiration: 7 days
  - Rotation on use
  - Stored securely (httpOnly cookie or secure storage)
