# The big picture

SwapJoy is a mobile app, which helps people to exchange what they no longer need, for what they love in the specific geographic region (it can be determined either by user's current location or by manually selecting city). They can explore or search the best matching items or item bundles, send or receive an offer. If the offer is accepted, they can contact each other and swap items.
